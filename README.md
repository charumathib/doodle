# Doodle
Authors: Charumathi Badrinath and Lawrence Zhang

The Doodle prototype is located at https://doodle-test-123456789.web.app, and the Github repository is located at https://github.com/charumathib/doodle.
No tutorial was followed in this prototype - everything was coded from scratch using React.
The user can, under each proposed meeting date/time, click on their availability to change between the green “yes” state, the yellow “yes, if need be” state, and the red “no” state. The user can also see others’ responses/availability (which are hardcoded into the web application for now). 

The key distinguishing features of Doodle (compared to When2Meet) are the following, which are implemented in our prototype above:
The meeting organizer has to previously have entered a total set of feasible/possible meeting dates/times, which are not editable by the meeting participants
Each participant can enter their availability for each of the possible meeting dates/times as a “yes”, “yes if need be”, or a “no”
Each participant can see every other participant’s availability/responses for each of the possible meeting dates/times
